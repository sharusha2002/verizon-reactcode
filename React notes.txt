Props vs States:

Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, 
while state is used to manage data within a component. 
Props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component,
 while state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.

constructor is a special function --> it is automatically called. Whenever and at the time of object creation.

In java it is called with class name and with no return type.

If we want to call again and again a function use it as a constructor
